I love technology and design. My dream is to build products that benefit millions of people. Before Makers Academy, I enjoy making physical things. I built a wide range of things from a [bioreactor](https://kyawtunsein.com/portfolio/lego-thor/) for micro-algae farming to a [timer](https://kyawtunsein.com/portfolio/mechanical-time-water-bottle/) to increase daily water intake.

After working on electronics, I realize that the software is the soul and how much my life is improved because of all the software I am currently using. That leads me to learn to code. I feel the same joy I have when building physical things! I am continuously learning not just about coding but also about software craftsmanship.
